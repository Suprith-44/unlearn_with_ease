## Machine Unlearning, a research project to selectively remove the influence of specific data pointsfrom trained models, without the need for complete retraining from scratch.
- Implemented Fast yet Effective Unlearning technique on CNN model trained on CIFAR-10 and achieved 100% success inunlearning the forget class and also improved the accuracy of retain class from 0.72 to 0.75
- Tech Stack: Pytorch, Tensorflow, React.js, Flask
